# Design System Implementation Proposal

## üéØ Overview

After analyzing Next Health's sophisticated brand aesthetic, I propose a comprehensive design system upgrade that will transform our functional dashboard into a premium health companion that matches Next Health's visual DNA.

## üîç Key Insights from Next Health Website

### **Brand Characteristics**
- **Typography**: Montserrat (primary) + Libre Baskerville (accent)
- **Aesthetic**: Scientific elegance with human warmth
- **Colors**: Sophisticated neutrals with strategic color usage
- **Layout**: Asymmetrical, generous whitespace, premium spacing
- **Personality**: Cutting-edge yet approachable, trustworthy

### **Current Dashboard Gap**
Our dashboard works well functionally but lacks the sophisticated brand polish that Next Health's $200+/month customers expect.

## üöÄ Proposed Immediate Actions

4. **Week 4**: Polish + documentation + deployment

**Outcome**: Production-ready design system matching Next Health brand

### **Option B: Rapid Brand Alignment**
