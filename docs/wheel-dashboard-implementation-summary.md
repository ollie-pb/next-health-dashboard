```typescript
// Smooth orbital motion with physics
const getMetricPosition = (metric: OrbitingMetric, time: number) => {
  const animatedAngle = metric.angle + (time * metric.orbitSpeed);
  const x = Math.cos((animatedAngle * Math.PI) / 180) * metric.radius;
  const y = Math.sin((animatedAngle * Math.PI) / 180) * metric.radius;
  return { x, y, angle: animatedAngle };
};
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth 60fps animations
- **Memoization**: React.useMemo for expensive calculations
